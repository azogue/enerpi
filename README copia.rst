⚡⚡ ︎ENERPI AC Current Meter for Raspberry PI ⚡⚡
===============================================

A sample project that exists as an aid to the `Python Packaging User Guide
<https://packaging.python.org>`_'s `Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing
Projects <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html>`_.

This projects does not aim to cover best practices for Python project
development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool
recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.

----

This is the README file for the project.

The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using ReStructured Text. It
will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as
the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written for
that purpose.

Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
a good idea, although a simple "What's New" section for the most recent version
may be appropriate.

==============================================================================================================================================================================================

Home Assistant is a home automation platform running on Python 3. The
goal of Home Assistant is to be able to track and control all devices at
home and offer a platform for automating control.

To get started:

.. code:: bash

    python3 -m pip install enerpi
    enerpi -h

Check out `the website <https://home-assistant.io>`__ for `a
demo <https://home-assistant.io/demo/>`__, installation instructions,
tutorials and documentation.

-  `See full list of supported
   devices <https://home-assistant.io/components/>`__

Build home automation on top of your devices:

-  Keep a precise history of every change to the state of your house
-  Turn on the lights when people get home after sunset
-  Turn on lights slowly during sunset to compensate for less light
-  Turn off all lights and devices when everybody leaves the house
-  Offers a `REST API <https://home-assistant.io/developers/rest_api/>`__
   and can interface with MQTT for easy integration with other projects
   like `OwnTracks <http://owntracks.org/>`__
-  Allow sending notifications using
   `Instapush <https://instapush.im>`__, `Notify My Android
   (NMA) <http://www.notifymyandroid.com/>`__,
   `PushBullet <https://www.pushbullet.com/>`__,
   `PushOver <https://pushover.net/>`__, `Slack <https://slack.com/>`__,
   `Telegram <https://telegram.org/>`__, `Join <http://joaoapps.com/join/>`__, and `Jabber
   (XMPP) <http://xmpp.org>`__

The system is built using a modular approach so support for other devices or actions can
be implemented easily. See also the `section on
architecture <https://home-assistant.io/developers/architecture/>`__
and the `section on creating your own
components <https://home-assistant.io/developers/creating_components/>`__.
